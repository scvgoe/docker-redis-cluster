This repo is almost same with [docker-redis-culster](https://github.com/Grokzen/docker-redis-cluster), except it's running port(7000 => 6379).

Docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/grokzen/redis-cluster/

Docker image with redis built and installed from source and a cluster is built.

The main primary use for this container is to test redis cluster code. Specially https://github.com/Grokzen/redis-py-cluster

This repo is not intended to be a production quality docker build. It will also not be changed to use multiple containers or move away from supervisord, or to have support for different cluster managers, for example kubernetes, docker-ee or swarm. It will also not be made to handle persistent data between runs. However, any suggestions on improvements will be considered.

The container is made to be quick and easy to start, use and run.


## Redis instances inside the container

The cluster is 6 redis instances running with 3 master & 3 slaves, one slave for each master. They run on ports 6379 to 6384.

If the flag `-e "STANDALONE=true"` is passed there is 2 standalone instances runnin on port 6385 and 6386.

If the flag `-e "SENTINEL=true"` is passed there are 3 Sentinel nodes running on ports 5000 to 5002 matching cluster's master instances.


This image requires at least `Docker` version 1.10 but the latest version is recommended.



# Important for Mac users

If you are using this container to run a redis cluster on your mac computer, then you need to configure the container to use another IP address for cluster discovery as it can't use the default discovery IP that is hardcoded into the container.

If you are using the docker-compose file to build the container, then you must export a envrionment variable on your machine before building the container.

```
# This will make redis do cluster discovery and bind all nodes to ip 127.0.0.1 internally

export REDIS_CLUSTER_IP=0.0.0.0
```

If you are downloading the container from dockerhub, you must add the internal IP envrionment variable to your `docker run` command.

```
docker run grokzen/redis-cluster:latest -e "IP=0.0.0.0" ...
```



# Usage

To build your own image run:

    make build

To run the container run:

    make up

To stop the container run:

    make down

To connect to your cluster you can use the redis-cli tool:

    redis-cli -c -p 6379

Or the built redis-cli tool inside the container that will connect to the cluster inside the container

    make cli


## Include standalone redis instances

Standalone instances is not enabled by default, but available to use to run 2 standalone redis instances that is not clustered.

If running with plain docker run

    docker run ... -e STANDALONE=true ...

When running with docker-compose, set the envrionment variable on your system `REDIS_USE_STANDALONE=true` and start your container or modify the `docker-compose.yml` file

      version: '2'
      services:
        redis-cluster:
          ...
        environment:
          STANDALONE: 'true'


## Include sentinel instances

Sentinel instances is not enabled by default.

If running with plain docker send in `-e SENTINEL=true`.

When running with docker-compose set the environment variable on your system `REDIS_USE_SENTINEL=true` and start your container.

      version: '2'
      services:
        redis-cluster:
          ...
        environment:
          SENTINEL: 'true'


## Build alternative redis versions

For a release to be buildable it needs to be present at this url: http://download.redis.io/releases/


### docker build

To build a different redis version use the argument `--build-arg` argument.

    # Example plain docker
    docker build --build-arg redis_version=4.0.12 -t grokzen/redis-cluster .


### docker-compose

To build a different redis version use the `--build-arg` argument.

    # Example docker-compose
    docker-compose build --build-arg "redis_version=4.0.12" redis-cluster
